# FlagGems Governance

## Overview

FlagGems is an open-source project under the [FlagOS](https://flagos.io/) ecosystem, developed and maintained by [BAAI (Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence)](https://www.baai.ac.cn/) and the open-source community. The project is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE).

This document describes how the FlagGems project is governed — the roles, responsibilities, decision-making processes, and policies that guide its development.

## Roles & Responsibilities

FlagGems recognizes three community roles. Each role builds on the previous one.

### Contributor

Anyone who contributes to FlagGems — including code, documentation, bug reports, reviews, or community support.

- **Rights**: Submit issues and pull requests; participate in discussions.
- **Requirements**: None. All contributions are welcome.

### Committer

A trusted contributor who has demonstrated sustained, high-quality contributions and a solid understanding of the project.

- **Rights**: All Contributor rights, plus write access to the repository (push to non-protected branches, triage issues, approve PRs).
- **How to become one**: Nominated by an existing Maintainer and approved by a majority of Maintainers (see [Nomination & Approval](#nomination--approval)).
- **Expectations**: Review PRs in their area of expertise; follow the project's coding standards and contribution guidelines.

### Maintainer

A Committer who takes on overall project stewardship — setting technical direction, managing releases, and ensuring project health.

- **Rights**: All Committer rights, plus merge to protected branches, approve releases, vote on governance matters, and nominate new Committers and Maintainers.
- **How to become one**: Nominated by an existing Maintainer and approved by a supermajority (2/3) of Maintainers.
- **Expectations**: Actively participate in project decisions; mentor Contributors and Committers; ensure timely reviews and releases.

The current list of Maintainers is in [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md).

## Nomination & Approval

1. An existing Maintainer opens a nomination issue (or email thread) describing the candidate's contributions.
2. Discussion period: **7 calendar days** for other Maintainers to provide feedback.
3. Vote:
   - **Committer nomination**: approved by a **simple majority** (> 50%) of active Maintainers.
   - **Maintainer nomination**: approved by a **supermajority** (≥ 2/3) of active Maintainers.
4. If approved, the nominee is added to the relevant list and granted appropriate access.

## Emeritus & Inactive Policy

Sustained participation is valued, but the project also respects that people's availability changes over time.

- **Inactive threshold**: If a Maintainer or Committer has had no meaningful project activity (code, review, issue triage, governance participation) for **12 consecutive months**, an active Maintainer will reach out to discuss their status.
- **Emeritus status**: If the individual confirms they wish to step back — or does not respond within 30 days — they are moved to **Emeritus** status in [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md).
- **Emeritus rights**: Emeritus members retain recognition for their contributions. They lose write access and voting rights but are welcome to participate as Contributors.
- **Returning**: An Emeritus member may return to active status through the standard [Nomination & Approval](#nomination--approval) process.

## Decision Making

### Lazy Consensus

Most day-to-day decisions (merging PRs, triaging issues, minor process changes) follow **lazy consensus**: a proposal is considered approved if no Maintainer objects within a reasonable period (typically 72 hours for non-trivial changes).

### Maintainer Vote

For decisions that cannot be resolved through lazy consensus — including architectural changes, policy changes, and disputed PRs:

1. Any Maintainer may call for a formal vote by opening a GitHub issue labeled `governance/vote`.
2. Voting period: **7 calendar days**.
3. Each active Maintainer has one vote. A **simple majority** (> 50%) is required.
4. In the event of a tie, the **Project Lead** (designated in [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md)) casts the deciding vote.

### Transparency

All governance decisions and vote outcomes are recorded in GitHub issues for public reference.

## Release Process

1. A **Release Manager** (a Maintainer, rotating per release) proposes a release by opening a tracking issue with the planned scope and timeline.
2. **Minor / patch releases**: approved through lazy consensus.
3. **Major releases**: require a Maintainer majority vote.
4. The Release Manager is responsible for tagging, changelog, and release artifacts.

## Amendments

Changes to this governance document require a **supermajority (≥ 2/3)** of active Maintainers, with a discussion period of at least **14 calendar days** before the vote.
