# Versioning

FlagGems uses [setuptools-scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools-scm) to
auto-generate version numbers from git tags following
[PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/).

## Version Format

| Scenario | Example version |
|----------|-----------------|
| On a release tag `v5.4.0` | `5.4.0` |
| N commits after dev tag `v5.4.0.dev0` | `5.4.0.devN+g<hash>` |
| On a dev tag `v5.4.0.dev0` | `5.4.0.dev0` |

**No version is hardcoded in any source file.** The version is derived entirely
from git tags at build time.

The `+g<hash>` suffix (local version label) is included in local and editable
installs, allowing developers to `git checkout <hash>` for debugging. This
suffix is automatically stripped when publishing to PyPI.

## Tag Naming Rules

| Tag pattern | Purpose | Triggers release CI? |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| `v5.4.0` | Stable release | ✅ Yes |
| `v5.4.0.dev0` | Start of dev cycle | ❌ No |
| `v5.4.0rc1` | Release candidate | ❌ No |
| `v5.4.0.post1` | Post-release fix | ✅ Yes |

## Development Cycle

After each stable release, a dev tag is created to mark the start of the next
version cycle:

```
v5.3.0          ← stable release
  │
  ├── commit 1  ← 5.4.0.dev1+gabcdef0
  ├── commit 2  ← 5.4.0.dev2+g1234567
  ├── ...
  ├── commit N  ← 5.4.0.devN+g<hash>
  │
v5.4.0          ← next stable release
  │
v5.5.0.dev0     ← start of next dev cycle
```

## Release Process

### Releasing a new version (e.g. v5.4.0)

1. **Ensure all PRs for the release are merged into `master`.**

2. **Tag the release:**
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   git tag v5.4.0
   git push origin v5.4.0
   ```

3. **CI builds release artifacts automatically.**
   The `release.yaml` workflow triggers on stable version tags
   (`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`) and builds the wheel, then publishes to PyPI.

4. **Start the next dev cycle:**
   ```bash
   git tag v5.5.0.dev0
   git push origin v5.5.0.dev0
   ```
   From this point, all commits on `master` produce versions like
   `5.5.0.dev1+gabcdef0`.

### Releasing a patch (e.g. v5.4.1)

1. Create a release branch if needed:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/5.4 v5.4.0
   ```
2. Cherry-pick or merge fixes.
3. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag v5.4.1
   git push origin v5.4.1
   ```

### Release candidates

Tag as `v5.4.0rc1`, `v5.4.0rc2`, etc. These are PEP 440 pre-releases and
will **not** trigger the release workflow (it only matches stable tags). To
build RC wheels, trigger the workflow manually or adjust the tag filter
temporarily.

## Checking the Current Version

```bash
# From a git checkout (diagnostic, not required for install):
python -m setuptools_scm

# From an installed package:
python -c "import flag_gems; print(flag_gems.__version__)"
```
